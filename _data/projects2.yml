  description: I showcase a method for evaluating monetary policy. I introduce a simple model, in which monetary policy can directly affect the magnitude of consumption growth. I argue that within such a framework evaluation of monetary policy can be simpler than the standard approach of the literature. In addition, a development of this approach could facilitate market-based evaluations of monetary policy that are based on fluctuations of real interest rates in response to monetary policy shocks.

# Jointly explaining stock market non-participation and the equity premium
- project: "Jointly Explaining Stock Market Non-Participation and the Equity Premium"
  description: I am working on a heterogeous agent model that shows the level of stock participation of individuals with different levels of risk aversion. I start by deriving the term structure of interests rates and the equity premium based on a consumption process with high levels of consumption volatility. I then derive the optimal investment and consumption levels of more risk-averse investors, including when there is a small friction in investing. I analyze the resulting stock market participation levels, the equity premium and the level of risk sharing provided by markets.
