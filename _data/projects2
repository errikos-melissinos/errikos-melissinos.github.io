  description: I showcase a method for evaluating monetary policy. I introduce a simple model, in which monetary policy can directly affect the magnitude of consumption growth. I argue that within such a framework evaluation of monetary policy can be simpler than the standard approach of the literature. In addition, a development of this ap- proach could facilitate market-based evaluations of monetary policy that are based on fluctuations of real interest rates in response to monetary policy shocks.
