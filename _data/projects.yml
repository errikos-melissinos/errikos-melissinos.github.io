  # description: I investigate the ability of consumption-based models to explain the positive time- varying term premia observed in the data. The long-run risk and rare disasters models typically fail by producing small and negative term premia. The habit model appears to be quite successful, but it generates heteroskedastic real interest rates, which are not supported by empirical evidence. Generally, my findings suggest that substantial and positive term premia require counter-cyclical real interest rates and a direct relationship between the stochastic discount factor and the state variable of the economy. My analysis considers models with both time-separable and recursive utility. For the latter, I present a perturbation solution method that facilitates the computation of the price of long-term bonds, while allowing for a wide range of values for the intertemporal elasticity of substitution parameter.
  description: I explore real bond term premia through a series of model variations within a unified consumption-based framework. I, thus, establish the combinations of utility functions with consumption processes that are able to generate mostly positive and substantially time-varying term premia as we see in the data. I provide term premia values conditional on the state of the economy, which allows me to verify the failure of standard consumption-based models in producing convincing term premia, but show the success of a model with an external habit. Furthermore, I demonstrate that high time-varying consumption volatility can also induce large and time-varying term premia, and I argue that this mechanism lies at the core of the success of recent literature that explains term premia through arbitrageurs. My analysis considers models with both time-separable and recursive utility functions. For the latter case, I introduce a perturbation solution method that facilitates the derivation of bond prices, while allowing for a wide range of values for the parameter of intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

  description: I introduce a novel method for solving recursive utility models in continuous time, offering an explicit expression of the value function. Building on the analytic solu- tion of Tsai and Wachter (2018), where the intertemporal elasticity of substitution parameter (IES) is set equal to 1, the proposed method utilizes a perturbation expansion around this value to derive an expression for the value function for a broad range of IES values. This method provides a straightforward and reliable approach to asset pricing with recursive utility in continuous time, applicable to various calibrations. Furthermore, it highlights the scope and limitations of the method presented in Tsai and Wachter (2018).

  description: In this paper, we introduce a framework with multidimensional skills, in which we estimate how fast skills accumulate due to on-the-job experience. We model an individualâ€™s wage as a weighted sum of her productivities in different skills. We call this skill-specific productivity expertise. Since expertise is not directly observable, we proxy this variable with skill-specific experience, which depends on the years of labor market experience across different occupations and the importance of the corresponding skill in those occupations. We compute skill-specific experience using the data on occupational skill requirements from O*NET. We then estimate the wage equation using skill-specific experience to evaluate the speed of expertise accumulation (learning rate) in different skills. We find that expertise in different skills grows with skill-specific experience and that different skills exhibit different learning rates.
