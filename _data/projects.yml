  # description: I investigate the ability of consumption-based models to explain the positive time- varying term premia observed in the data. The long-run risk and rare disasters models typically fail by producing small and negative term premia. The habit model appears to be quite successful, but it generates heteroskedastic real interest rates, which are not supported by empirical evidence. Generally, my findings suggest that substantial and positive term premia require counter-cyclical real interest rates and a direct relationship between the stochastic discount factor and the state variable of the economy. My analysis considers models with both time-separable and recursive utility. For the latter, I present a perturbation solution method that facilitates the computation of the price of long-term bonds, while allowing for a wide range of values for the intertemporal elasticity of substitution parameter.
  description: In the data, real term premia are mostly positive and time-varying. So, I explore to what extent various consumption-based mechanisms generate these features. My investigation uncovers a novel and simple consumption-based approach, involving high time-varying consumption volatility, that produces the patterns that we see in the data. In relation to preferences, I consider models with both time-separable and recursive utility functions. For the latter case I introduce a novel perturbation solution method, which is easy to implement, and allows a wide range of values for the parameter of intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

  description: I illustrate a novel method for pricing assets within recursive utility models in continuous time, that has first been used in Melissinos (2023). My method builds on the analytic solution of Tsai and Wachter (2018). While their solution is valid for a value of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution equal to 1, I provide the full perturbation series in terms of the IES, which gives rise to a global perturbation approximation. This allows the pricing of assets for a much larger range of values for the IES, which are economically meaningful. I comment on the convergence properties of the perturbation series, and I show that the method provides a straightforward and reliable approach to asset pricing. I employ my method to derive prices of long-term bonds, the price consumption ratio and the instantaneous return of the consumption perpetuity.

  description: In this paper, we introduce a framework with multidimensional skills, in which we estimate how fast skills accumulate due to on-the-job experience. We model an individualâ€™s wage as a weighted sum of her productivities in different skills. We call this skill-specific productivity expertise. Since expertise is not directly observable, we proxy this variable with skill-specific experience, which depends on the years of labor market experience across different occupations and the importance of the corresponding skill in those occupations. We compute skill-specific experience using the data on occupational skill requirements from O*NET. We then estimate the wage equation using skill-specific experience to evaluate the speed of expertise accumulation (learning rate) in different skills. We find that expertise in different skills grows with skill-specific experience and that different skills exhibit different learning rates.
