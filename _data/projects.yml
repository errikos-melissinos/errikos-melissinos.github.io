  # description: I investigate the ability of consumption-based models to explain the positive time- varying term premia observed in the data. The long-run risk and rare disasters models typically fail by producing small and negative term premia. The habit model appears to be quite successful, but it generates heteroskedastic real interest rates, which are not supported by empirical evidence. Generally, my findings suggest that substantial and positive term premia require counter-cyclical real interest rates and a direct relationship between the stochastic discount factor and the state variable of the economy. My analysis considers models with both time-separable and recursive utility. For the latter, I present a perturbation solution method that facilitates the computation of the price of long-term bonds, while allowing for a wide range of values for the intertemporal elasticity of substitution parameter.
  description: I employ a consumption-based framework to analyse the term structure of real interest rates across a range of model variations. The goal is to identify the utility specifications and the consumption processes that generate positive and substantially time-varying real term premia as we see in the data. Standard utility specifications with a representative consumption process fail to generate such term premia. However, a model with an external habit and a model with high time-varying consumption volatility succeed. This suggests that the bond market includes investors who have a utility function with an external habit, or whose consumption is highly volatile, or both. My analysis considers models with both time-separable and recursive utility functions. For the latter, I introduce a perturbation solution method that facilitates the derivation of long-term interest rates, while allowing for a wide range of values for the parameter of intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

  description: I introduce a novel method for solving recursive utility models in continuous time, offering an explicit expression of the value function. Building on the analytic solu- tion of Tsai and Wachter (2018), where the intertemporal elasticity of substitution parameter (IES) is set equal to 1, the proposed method utilizes a perturbation expansion around this value to derive an expression for the value function for a broad range of IES values. This method provides a straightforward and reliable approach to asset pricing with recursive utility in continuous time, applicable to various calibrations. Furthermore, it highlights the scope and limitations of the method presented in Tsai and Wachter (2018).

# Early Work: Monetary Policy Evaluation in Real Models

  description: I showcase a method for evaluating monetary policy. I introduce a simple model, in which monetary policy can directly affect the magnitude of consumption growth. I argue that within such a framework evaluation of monetary policy can be simpler than the standard approach of the literature. In addition, a development of this ap- proach could facilitate market-based evaluations of monetary policy that are based on fluctuations of real interest rates in response to monetary policy shocks.

# Measuring On-the-job Learning Rates in Multidimensional Skills
- project: Measuring On-the-job Learning Rates in Multidimensional Skills, with Mariia Bondar

  description: In this paper, we introduce a framework with multidimensional skills, in which we estimate how fast skills accumulate due to on-the-job experience. We model an individualâ€™s wage as a weighted sum of her productivities in different skills. We call this skill-specific productivity expertise. Since expertise is not directly observable, we proxy this variable with skill-specific experience, which depends on the years of labor market experience across different occupations and the importance of the corresponding skill in those occupations. We compute skill-specific experience using the data on occupational skill requirements from O*NET. We then estimate the wage equation using skill-specific experience to evaluate the speed of expertise accumulation (learning rate) in different skills. We find that expertise in different skills grows with skill-specific experience and that different skills exhibit different learning rates.
